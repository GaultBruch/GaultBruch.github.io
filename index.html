									<h3>Overview</h3>
									<p>
										This is a full stack MERN application for organizing task lists for multiple projects, and features a deadline system. Obviously on a small scale that can be done in a notebook, but I wanted a list I could easily access across multiple devices anywhere I was.
										This lead me to a full stack application, and having a solid foundation of a react frontend I decided on the MERN stack. Before the project started I created a software requirements specification (SRS sheet) to get me started on the right track and provide direction to the project.
									</p>
								</div>
								<div class="main">
									<h3>Project Difficulties</h3>
									<p>
										During the project I had decided on Auth0 to run user authentication, rather than a custom made service, as I thought that an auth0 service would be easily extendable. Sadly, Auth0 does not handle custom user databases well, and it became apparent that it would be 
										more of a headache than a boon. I lost about 2 weeks of progress on the project after deciding to remove auth0, but the rest of the project proceeded much smoother with custom authentication instead.
									</p>
								</div>
								<div class="end">
									<h3>End Result</h3>
									<p>
										Overall, I am extremely happy with how this project turned out, although some features have been left to later updates in the interest of time. As my first large project this taught me a lot about not only the technologies involved and the process of getting a (rudimentary) full stack application running, but also how to manage tasks and long term goals within larger web based coding projects.
										There are more updates for the service planned for the future, and I currently use it on my own projects to provide a ledger of goals and completed work.

											<h3>Overview</h3>
											<p>
												I wanted a bit more experience workin on creating frontend pages, and wanted to try out a few new tools, like Tailwind and NextJS. I chose to set up a running shop frontpage advertising some shoes.
											</p>
										</div>
										<div class="middle">
											<h3>Project Difficulties</h3>
											<p>
												This went fairly smoothly for the most part. Tailwind was a huge boon, and I liked the functionality it allowed, but getting NextJS hosted on github lead to some small issues at the very end of the project.
												Mainly issues arose with the way NextJS exports handle the image elements, since it doesn't interact well with Tailwind.
											</p>
										</div>
									<div class="end">
											<h3>End Result</h3>
												<p>
													I like the stylistic choice made on the site, but feel like I'm still a bit fresh to good designs. I liked the figma mockup a lot, and while some things had to be lost in translation,
													for a 3 day project while learning tailwind I am overall happy with it. Because the images were sourced from online I had to do some quick editing to them to line them up, but the NextJS export 
													issues broke that, so in another project I'd likely head back and rebuild them, but for this project it doesn't add much to my learning experience to fiddle around with it.

											<h3>Overview</h3>
											<p>
												This idea came about after discussion with a team lead for a organization in my town realizing that it was a bit frustrating trying to get all
												the certifications for large teams tracked. I set up an excel file for them, but due to the fact that many people could access it the file logic was destroyed accidentally.
												Instead, it would be convenient for a consistent way for people to only see the certifications they need to see, while also allowing team leads to access their team members certification list.
													Additionally, I also wanted it to be able to send emails off to team leads as well as signed up members if they are about to miss out on a certification.
												</p>
												<p>Beyond the practicality from a business standpoint, I chose to try out SQL for this server, since I wanted practice using it in a hierarchical dataset.</p>

											<h3>Overview</h3>
											<p>
												This was my first react project, and an opportunity to learn more about the structure for building an app, and was a good introduction to the use of state and props.
											</p>
										</div>
										<div class="middle">
											<h3>Project Difficulties</h3>
											<p>
												A lot of the difficulties from this project came from a lack of understanding of react architecture. Halfway through the project I had to rewrite the state architecture, as the 
												game winstate was not being calculated correctly. Beyond the win state, this code tested my scripting abilities within the react framework. While a similar project in a language like
												python or C is relatively straightforward, the displaying of the resulting keypresses and updating of the colours of the squares on the frontend did pose a challenge initially.
											</p>
										</div>
									<div class="end">
											<h3>End Result</h3>
											<p>I'm fairly happy with how the end result turned out, especially on the scripting side to get the backend working. As this was a test project for react I did not focus
													too heavily on presentation, something that could be improved if I were to do it over again.
