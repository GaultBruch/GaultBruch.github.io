											<h3>Overview</h3>
											<p>
													This was my first react project, and an opportunity to learn more about the structure for building an app, and was a good introduction to the use of state and props.
											</p>
									</div>
									<div class="middle">
											<h3>Project Difficulties</h3>
											<p>
													A lot of the difficulties from this project came from a lack of understanding of react architecture. Halfway through the project I had to rewrite the state architecture, as the 
													game winstate was not being calculated correctly. Beyond the win state, this code tested my scripting abilities within the react framework. While a similar project in a language like
													python or C is relatively straightforward, the displaying of the resulting keypresses and updating of the colours of the squares on the frontend did pose a challenge initially.
											</p>
									</div>
									<div class="end">
											<h3>End Result</h3>
											<p>I'm fairly happy with how the end result turned out, especially on the scripting side to get the backend working. As this was a test project for react I did not focus
													too heavily on presentation, something that could be improved if I were to do it over again.

													<h3>Overview</h3>
													<p>
															This is a full stack MERN application for organizing task lists for multiple projects, and features a deadline system. Obviously on a small scale that can be done in a notebook, but I wanted a list I could easily access across multiple devices anywhere I was.
															This lead me to a full stack application, and having a solid foundation of a react frontend I decided on the MERN stack. Before the project started I created a software requirements specification (SRS sheet) to get me started on the right track and provide direction to the project.
													</p>
											</div>
											<div class="main">
													<h3>Project Difficulties</h3>
													<p>
															During the project I had decided on Auth0 to run user authentication, rather than a custom made service, as I thought that an auth0 service would be easily extendable. Sadly, Auth0 does not handle custom user databases well, and it became apparent that it would be 
															more of a headache than a boon. I lost about 2 weeks of progress on the project after deciding to remove auth0, but the rest of the project proceeded much smoother with custom authentication instead.
													</p>
											</div>
											<div class="end">
													<h3>End Result</h3>
													<p>
															Overall, I am extremely happy with how this project turned out, although some features have been left to later updates in the interest of time. As my first large project this taught me a lot about not only the technologies involved and the process of getting a (rudimentary) full stack application running, but also how to manage tasks and long term goals within larger web based coding projects.
															There are more updates for the service planned for the future, and I currently use it on my own projects to provide a ledger of goals and completed work.
