      <h2>Personal Summary</h2>
      <p>I am an ex-research student turned web developer, pulling on my previous years of coding both in an academic and personal sense. I have on-site experience connecting and automating hardware and software packages, with much of my previous work being in Python. During my time learning web development, I have specialized myself mostly in React as a frontend framework, and am working to garner a solid foundation in fullstack development. I am most familiar with the MERN stack, but I believe my previous experience
        allows for solid adaptation to other stacks and roles as necessary. My web development journey has been a self taught one, but I have attempted to consider the roles and challenges I would face in larger companies into my roadmap.
        I am always looking forward to new opportunities for learning, and believe personal development is the forefront of professional development.
      </p>

      <h2>Technical Background</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Foundational understanding of the MERN stack, having built a project from the ground up from backend to frontend from a self built software requirement sheet.</li>
        <li>Experience building relational (SQL Server) and document based (MongoDB) databases for frontend consumption</li>
        <li>Background in React 16, using both class and functional components.</li>
        <li>Experience building and consuming RESTful APIs</li>
        <li>Understanding of HTML, CSS3, and current JavaScript ES6 practices (This site is built with it!)</li>
        <li>Utilized Figma to build out templates for website designs</li>
        <li>Solid understanding of Git</li>
        <li>Work experience with computer pairing and hardware automation using a self-built socket server.</li>
        <li>Experience with Python program optimization using GPU computing and LLVM conversion to speed up computational calculations for molecular simulations.</li>
        <li>Experience working with machine learning packages (Tensorflow, PyTorch) as well as building small machine learning projects in Python</li>
      </ul>
